      <p>
        Having been born in the Mid West, raised in the South East, and now residing in the Pacific North West, I suppose you could say I have been around.<br></br>
        When it comes to hobbies, I would describe myself as a committed, casual gamer. No, I don't care muh for PC games and no I am not hyper competitive, but I do like to have the most up-to-date consoles and peripheral tech to enhance my experience.<br></br>
        Outside of gaming, I also enjoy staying active through home and gym workouts, hikes out in the woods, and walks around the neighborhood.<br></br>
        I would consider myself pretty friendly and open, so feel free to say "Hi!" sometime!
